        <p>
          I am a passionate learner when it comes to anything computer
          related. For my 9th birthday, was gifted a Gateway computer
          and I became obsessed with learning how it worked. Ever
          since Iâ€™ve have been refining my skills. My experience with
          coding started very early on in the battle.net 1.0 days, I
          love gaming and I got together with a group of developers
          that had programmed chat bots for the community among other
          apps gaming related. I quickly became fascinated with Visual
          Basic and started doing simple debugging for the community.
          As I grew older life took me down a different path and as a
          father of a 9 year old I got back in to coding and dedicated
          a whole year of my life to catch up with all that I missed.
